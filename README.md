| #21 | 8 hours | linked lists | Learning more about classes and grasping how to update nodes in a linked list. | First time exposure to linked lists |
| #121 | 40 minutes | Arrays/Lists | Thinking of the best way to layout the logic. | This was a good exercise, I thought it was the perfect amount of challenge and easy |
| #125 | 10 minutes | Strings | N/A did this challenge before so it was pretty easy | Pretty easy maybe because I'm comfortable with string slicing?|
